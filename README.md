Continuation of squash-shop-project, but now spring and angular run together in one build

How to start a project:
- when you copy the project to the local repository, in the project root, use command: mvn spring-boot:run
  *wait a little bit when the project download all dependencies and starts program
 
- when the project started, you can use also in the project root, command ./ng build --watch
  *it will update all changes in the angular side dynamically
